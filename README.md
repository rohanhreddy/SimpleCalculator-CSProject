# Simple Calculator üçµ

This calculator has been made as a end-of-the-year project for my junior year in high school.

It is made in Python 3 and runs on most compatable sytems and also offers a native .exe file for windows based systems.

The calculator is capable of performing arithmetic and even calculus operations using only Python code.

## Installation ‚¨áÔ∏è

#### For windows based systems, the executable (.exe) can be found [here](https://github.com/rohanhreddy/SimpleCalculator-CSProject/releases) and can be used without any pre-requisites.

#### For MacOS and Linux based systems there are some pre-requisites that need to be fulfilled:

Firstly, please ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) has been installed on your system. Then run the following commands in the terminal:

#### Note: Please skip this if [mpmath](https://mpmath.org/) and [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) are already installed
```bash
  pip install mpmath
```
Once complete, run:
```bash
    pip install sympy
```
#### Now download the SimpleCalculator.py file from [releases](https://github.com/rohanhreddy/SimpleCalculator-CSProject/releases) and run the following from the terminal each time you want to launch the calculator:
```bash
    python3 SimpleCalculator.py
```
While doing so ensure you are in the same directory as the file, or alternatively right-click and select open with python if your OS supports it.
